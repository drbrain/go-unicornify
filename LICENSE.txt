gopyrand
--------

Go-Unicornify uses my gopyrand library from https://bitbucket.org/balpha/gopyrand/wiki/Home.

The original gopyrand code is MIT-licensed just like Go-Unicornify, but it
(somewhat) contains third-party code. In particular, Go-Unicornify binaries
have this code compiled in, and thus the third-party licenses apply.

See https://bitbucket.org/balpha/gopyrand/src/tip/LICENSE.txt, which contains
the following:


The file implementation.go contains a port of the MT19937 implementation by
Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto, as present in the CPython source code.
See the file for details (as far as I can tell, the license is a standard BSD
3-clause license).

Other parts of this library are ported from, adapted from, or inspired by CPython
code, mainly http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/faef1da30c6d/Lib/random.py. I do
not know whether there is enough significance in what I took from there to fall
under copyright protection, but it doesn't really matter. The Python source code
is Copyright (C) 2001-2014 Python Software Foundation with All Rights Reserved, and
licensed under the Python Software Foundation License. See http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c0bcf1383d77/LICENSE
and https://docs.python.org/2/license.html for more details.
